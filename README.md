# 5-3-Project-Two-CS-210 Relection

Description:
This project, of significant importance to Airgead Banking, involved developing an interactive application in C++ for our esteemed client, a partner of Chada Tech. The application elucidates the concept of fiscal responsibility, explicitly focusing on investing and compound interest. Our primary goal was to create a program that would allow users to witness the growth of their investments over time while adhering to the functional requirements set by Airgead Banking and following the practices outlined in the Airgead Banking Standards document. Before writing the code, I meticulously crafted pseudocode to brainstorm for the project, breaking it down step by step. This was then implemented in the coding process.

Reflection:
I believe I implemented a clear and intuitive user interface that guides users through the input process and displays results in an organized fashion. The code follows best practices and adheres to given standards. However, enhancing the error-handling mechanism to expand accessibility was a challenge I overcame with diligence. Implementing the compound interest calculation logic took a lot of work due to the complexity of the formula and the need for precision handling of floating-point numbers. I addressed this challenge by breaking it down into smaller, manageable parts. 
From this project, I have acquired invaluable skills that will smoothly incorporate user input, perform calculations, and display results in a user-friendly way. These skills will be particularly transferable to other projects and coursework, enhancing their value and impact. To ensure the program's maintainability, readability, and adaptability, I used meaningful  variable names, clear comments, and consistent coding conventions to improve readability.
